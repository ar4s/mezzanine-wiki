Mezzanine
=========

Mezzanine is a content management platform built using the `Django`_
framework. It is `BSD licensed`_ and designed to provide both a
consistent interface for managing content, and a simple, extensible
architecture that makes diving in and hacking on the code as easy as
possible.

Mezzanine resembles tools like `Wordpress`_, with an intuitive
interface for managing pages, blog posts, form data, store products,
or any other type of content you can imagine. Mezzanine takes a
different approach from other Django applications in this space like
`Pinax`_ or `Mingus`_ that glue together a lot of reusable apps,
instead opting to provide most of its functionality included with the
project by default.

Visit the `Mezzanine project page`_ to see some of the great sites
people have built using Mezzanine.
